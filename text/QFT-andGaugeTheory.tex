\section{Lagrangian formalism of fields}

In quantum field theory the dynamics of a system is described using the Lagrangian formalism, but instead of considering the Lagrangian itself one consider the \emph{Lagrangian density}\index{Lagrangian density} $\L$, which is a function of one or more fields \emph{fields}\index{field} $\{\psi_i\}$ and their space- and time-derivatives $\{\partial_\mu \psi_i\}$.


\ldots

\begin{align} \label{eq:LagrangianFormalism_ConjugateMomentumField}
    \pi_i &= \pdv{\L}{\dot{\psi}_i}
\end{align}

$\dot{\psi}_i = \partial_0\psi_i$

\begin{align} \label{eq:LagrangianFormalism_HamiltonianDensity}
    \H &= \sum_i \pi_i \dot{\psi}_i - \L
\end{align}

\begin{align} \label{eq:LagrangianFormalism_Hamiltonian}
    H &= \int \dd[3]{x} \H

\subsection{Dirac field}

Due to our interest in examining confinement of quarks, which are spin-\half fermions, we will take as the starting point the most prominent fermionic field, namely the Dirac field. For this field the Lagrangian density\index{Lagrangian density!of Dirac field} is
\begin{align} \label{eq:DiracLagrangiangDensity}
    \L_D &= \psibar (i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m) \psi \: ,
\end{align}


% Write that we would later look at the constrain to (1+1)d, thus the gamma matrices of these...



\subsection{Local U(1) gauge invariance}

When considering systems one may often also consider their symmetries. Generally a \emph{symmetry}\index{symmetry} is written as an invariance of the action, and thus of the Lagrangian density, with respect to transformation represented by operators \cite{peskin_introToQFT_1995}. The set of these operators is called the \emph{symmetry group}\index{symmetry!symmetry group} due to the Lagrangian density being invariant under these and their compositions \cite{panyella_masterThesis_2019}. In the following we will consider the unitary gauge U(1)\index{U(1)}\index{symmetry!U(1)|see{U(1)}}, where the name refers to it being the group of unitary $1\times1$ matrices also known complex numbers with modulus $1$ \cite{peskin_introToQFT_1995}. One of these transformations is the phase of a wave function
\begin{align} \label{eq:GlobalU(1)GaugeInvariance}
    \psi &\rightarrow U_\alpha \psi = \exp{i\alpha}\psi \: ,
\end{align}
with $\alpha$ being a real number. A Lagrangian density being invariant under this transformation is said to be \emph{globally gauge invariant}\index{gauge invariance!global}, thus the wave function's phase will vanish by choosing the correct gauge. Due to $U_\alpha$ being a number and exploiting its unitarity, $U_\alpha\dagger U_\alpha = \id$, it is trivial to show that the Dirac Lagrangian density $\L_D$ is globally U(1) gauge invariant.

In developing quantum field theory one shall not only impose global gauge invariance but instead demand the more strict \emph{local gauge invariance}\index{gauge invariance!local} \cite{griffiths_introToElementaryParticles_2008}. For the transformation in \cref{eq:GlobalU(1)GaugeInvariance} this implies, that the parameter $\alpha$ shall be spacetime-dependent, $\alpha(x^\mu)$. As for most systems, the Dirac Lagrangian density is not locally invariant as it is, thus introduction of new fields for the system to interact with is required \cite{panyella_masterThesis_2019}. As it happens, the requirement of local gauge invariance supplied a systematic way for determining the equations describing the fundamental interactions: The electromagnetic interaction requires -- as we will derive later in this section -- local U(1) invariance, the electroweak interaction requires local SU(2)$\otimes$U(1) invariance\footnote{SU(N)\index{symmetry!SU(N)} being the the group of all unitary $N \times N$ matrices with determinant $1$ \cite{peskin_introToQFT_1995}.}, and the strong nuclear interaction requires local SU(3) invariance \cite{standford_QFT, griffiths_introToElementaryParticles_2008}, thus the Standard Model of elementary particle physics is a gauge theory resulting from demanding local U(1)$\otimes$SU(2)$\otimes$SU(3) symmetry \cite{standford_historyOfQFT}.

In the following it will be shown, that the Dirac Lagrangian density, \cref{eq:DiracLagrangiangDensity}, is not locally U(1) invariant, but it will lay the foundation for deriving one that is. The derivation will follow that of Refs. \cite{peskin_introToQFT_1995, griffiths_introToElementaryParticles_2008, panyella_masterThesis_2019}. To lighten the the notation, the parameter $\alpha(x^\mu)$ will be denoted $\alpha$ for the rest of this section. From \cref{eq:GlobalU(1)GaugeInvariance} the conjugated field must transform as
\begin{align}
    \psibar &\rightarrow \gamma^0 (\psi')\dagger
        = \gamma^0 (U_\alpha \psi)\dagger
        = \gamma^0\psi\dagger U_\alpha\dagger
        = \psibar\exp{-i\alpha} \: ,
\end{align}
for $\psi'$ being the U(1) transformed field, $\psi' = U_\alpha \psi$. Thus Dirac's Lagrangian density will transform as
\begin{align} \label{eq:DiracLagrangianDensityLackLocalU(1)Symmetry}
\begin{split}
    \L_D = \psibar (i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m) \psi \rightarrow
        & \psibar \exp{-i\alpha} (i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m) \exp{i\alpha} \psi \\
        =& \psibar \exp{-i\alpha} \exp{i\alpha} (i \gamma^\mu [i \partial_\mu \alpha + \partial_\mu] - m) \psi \\
        =& \L_D - \psibar\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \alpha \psi
\end{split}
\end{align}
exploiting again the unitarity of the U(1) symmetry group, $U_\alpha\dagger U_\alpha = \id$. From \cref{eq:DiracLagrangianDensityLackLocalU(1)Symmetry} it can be seen, that the differential operator is to blame for the lack of local gauge invariance. Thus one must introduce the \emph{gauge covariant derivative}\index{gauge covariant derivative}
\begin{align} \label{eq:GaugeCovariantDerivative}
    D_\mu &= \partial_\mu + iqA_\mu \: ,
\end{align}
which will replace the original derivative. In \cref{eq:GaugeCovariantDerivative} $A_\mu$\index{Amu@$A_\mu$} is a vector field which under U(1) symmetry transforms as
\begin{align}
    qA_\mu &\rightarrow qA_\mu - \partial_\mu\alpha \: ,
\end{align}
for $q$ being a real number. Using this new gauge covariant derivative, the Lagrangian density becomes locally U(1) gauge invariant:
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
    \psibar (i \gamma^\mu D_\mu - m) \psi \rightarrow
        & \psibar \exp{-i\alpha} (i \gamma^\mu [\partial_\mu + iqA_\mu - i\partial_\mu\alpha] - m) \exp{i\alpha} \psi \\
        =& \psibar (i \gamma^\mu [\partial_\mu + i \partial_\mu \alpha + iqA_\mu - i\partial_\mu\alpha] - m) \psi \\
        =& \psibar (i \gamma^\mu D_\mu - m) \psi \: .
\end{split}
\end{align}
However, there is still one important addition to the Lagrangian density, which we have still not accounted for: For the newly introduced vector field we have only introduced its coupling to the already existing field, $\psi$, but we also need to include its own ''free'' term, i.e. its kinetic energy term. The usual form of the kinetic energy is to be a scalar and the square of the derivative of the field, thus we set these as the requirements of $A_\mu$'s kinetic energy. Thus we propose the term $F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$,
\begin{align}
    F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu \: ,
\end{align}
being the \emph{gauge field tensor}\index{gauge field tensor}\index{Fmunu@$F_{\mu\nu}$|see{gauge field tensor}} \cite{griffiths_introToEldyn_2017}. Since the gauge field tensor transforms as
\begin{align}
    F_{\mu\nu} \rightarrow F_{\mu\nu} - \partial_\mu A_\nu \alpha + \partial_\nu A_\mu \alpha \: ,
\end{align}
it is gauge invariant, assuming that $\alpha$ is well-behaved such that the order of the derivatives is irrelevant, $\partial_\mu\partial_\nu\alpha = \partial_\nu\partial_\mu\alpha$, thus they will cancel each other.

Combining the above results in the locally U(1) gauge invariant Lagrangian density
\begin{align} \label{eq:ContinuumSchwingerModelLagrangianDensity}
    \L &= \psibar (i \gamma^\mu D_\mu - m) \psi - \frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} \: ,
\end{align}
where the factor of $-\nicefrac{1}{4}$ is due to convention. This is the Lagrangian density of \emph{quantum electrodynamics}\index{Lagrangian density!of quantum electrodynamics}, and for (1+1)D it is known as the Lagrangian density of the \emph{continuum Schwinger model}\index{Schwinger model!continuum}\index{Lagrangian density!Schwinger model!continuum} \cite{melnikov_latticeSchwingerModel_2000}.



\subsection{Hamiltonian density}

In this section the arguments will mostly follow that of Ref. \cite{melnikov_latticeSchwingerModel_2000}. We choose make the common gauge restriction to work in the temporal gauge, thus the temporal part of the the vector field $A_\mu$ is zero, $A_0 = 0$. From this choice of gauge and that of working in (1+1)-dimensions, i.e. $\mu,\nu = 0,1$, one can reduce \cref{eq:ContinuumSchwingerModelLagrangianDensity} to
\begin{align} \label{eq:ContinuumSchwingerModelLagrangianDensityAfterA0=0}
    \L &= \psibar (i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - \gamma^1 q A_1 - m) \psi + \frac{1}{2}E_1E^1 \: ,
\end{align}
where $E_1 = \partial_0 A_1$ is the electric field in the direction of $x_1$. Computing the last term of \cref{eq:ContinuumSchwingerModelLagrangianDensityAfterA0=0} requires one to remember, that the gauge field tensor is an antisymmetric tensor, $F_{\mu\nu} = - F_{\nu\mu}$, and that a contravariant tensor can be found by flipping the sign on the entries in the covariant tensor, for which the index is $0$, $F^{0\nu} = -F_{0\nu}$, \cite{griffiths_introToEldyn_2017}, thus
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
    F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} &= F_{00}F^{00} + F_{01}F^{01} + F_{10}F^{10} + F_{11}F^{11}     = F_{01}F^{01} + F_{10}F^{10} \\
        &= 2F_{01}F^{01}
        = -2F_{01}^2
        = -2(\partial_0A_1 - \partial_1A_0)^2
        = -2(\partial_0A_1)^2 \: ,
\end{split}
\end{align}
for $\mu,\nu = 0,1$.

The continuum Schwinger model Hamiltonian density can now be found using \cref{eq:LagrangianFormalism_ConjugateMomentumField,eq:LagrangianFormalism_HamiltonianDensity,eq:LagrangianFormalism_Hamiltonian} on \cref{eq:ContinuumSchwingerModelLagrangianDensityAfterA0=0}. The Hamiltonian density\index{Schwinger model!continuum}\index{Hamiltonian density!Schwinger model!continuum} therefor becomes
\begin{align} \label{eq:ContinuumSchwingerModelHamiltonianDensity}
\begin{split}
    \H &= \pdv{\L}{(\partial_0 A_1)} \partial_0 A_1 + \pdv{\L}{(\partial_0 \psi)} \partial_0 \psi - \L \\
        &= \partial^0 A^1 \partial_0 A_1 + \psibar i \gamma^0 \partial_0 \psi - \psibar (i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - \gamma^1 q A_1 - m) \psi - \frac{1}{2} E_1 E^1 \\
        &= E^1 E_1 + \psibar i \gamma^0 \partial_0 \psi - \psibar i \gamma^0 \partial_0 \psi - \psibar (i \gamma^1 \partial_1 - \gamma^1 q A_1 - m) \psi - \frac{1}{2} E_1 E^1 \\
        &= - \psibar (i \gamma^1 D_1 - m) \psi + \frac{1}{2} E_1 E^1 \: ,
\end{split}
\end{align}
and thus we get the Hamiltonian as the spatial integral of the above density
\begin{align}
    H &= \int \dd{x} \left[ - \psibar (i \gamma^1 D_1 - m) \psi + \frac{1}{2} E_1 E^1 \right] \: .
\end{align}
