The vacuum energy per site is obtained to an accuracy of 0.1\%. The masses of the first two excited states are found to within an accuracy of order 1\%, and between 1 and 5\%, respectively.

The continuum string tension and chiral order parameter are calculated with good accuracy. It is thus demonstrated that a “staggered fermion” formulation is capable of correctly reproducing chiral symmetry effects such as the axial anomaly in the continuum limit. The phase structure of the model conforms to the predictions of Coleman.},

    abstract    = {The energy spectrum of a system containing a static quark anti-quark pair is computed for a wide range of source separations using lattice QCD with Nf=2+1 dynamical flavours. By employing a variational method with a basis including operators resembling both the gluon string and systems of two separated static mesons, the first three energy levels are determined up to and beyond the distance where it is energetically favourable for the vacuum to screen the static sources through light- or strange-quark pair creation, enabling both these screening phenomena to be observed. The separation dependence of the energy spectrum is reliably parameterised over this saturation region with a simple model which can be used as input for subsequent investigations of quarkonia above threshold and heavy-light and heavy-strange coupled-channel meson scattering.}
